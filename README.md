## Project Description
The Geographical data is scrapped from the Wikipedia page using BeautifulSoup Package in Python. Further, the latitude and longitude information is added using FourSquare API
to get a clear picture of the location of neighborhoods and the venues. The data is segmented using k-means clustering in Python. This segments the neighborhood based on 
its similarity and divides it into 3 clusters. Clusters with high, low and medium concentration of shopping malls.
